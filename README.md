# Knapsack Problem | Probleme-sac-à-dos
This reposotory contains a Operationel research optimization problem known as Knapsack problem or the backpack problem "problème de sac à dos" in frensh, the solution is coded in java.
## Introduction to the Knapsack problem
The Knapsack problem is a classical problem in operations research and combinarorial optimization. It is often used to illustrate concepts such as optimization and dynamic programming
## Defining the main field 
### Combiantorial optimization 
Combinatorial Optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that deals with finding the best solution from a finite set of possible solutions for a problem with a discret variables 
## Problem Description 
In the Knapsack problem, you're given a knapsackwith a limited capacity and sets of objects, each with a value let's assume that is the price of the object or its importance and a weight the physical weight (measured in kg or pounds)  or the size pf the object . The objective is to determine the combination of objects to place in the knapsack in order to maximizes the totale value while respecting the weight constraint of the knapsack

# Additional Information 
## Problem Computational Complexity 
First of all the Compuational complexity measured the efficeney of an algorithm or a problem-solving approach. It quantify the amount of ressources, such as time and memory required by an algorithm to solve a problem as the problem size grows. 
In general we commonly used two measures of computational complexity :

__-Time Complexity__ : measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem, as a function of the problem size. 

__-Space Complexity__ : measures the amount of memory an algorith requires to solve a problem.

Both the Time and space complexity is typically expressed by  big O notation
