les tp de RO 
This reposotory contains a Operationel research optimization problem known as Knapsack problem or the backpack problem "problème de sac à dos" in frensh, the solution is coded in java.
## Introduction to the Knapsack problem
The Knapsack problem is a classical problem in operations research and combinarorial optimization. It is often used to illustrate concepts such as optimization and dynamic programming
## Defining the main field 
### Combiantorial optimization 
combinatorial optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that deals with finding the best solution from a finite set of possible solutions for a problem with a discret variables 
## Problem Desciption 
In the Knapsack problem, you're given a knapsackwith a limited capacity and sets of objects, each with a value let's assume that is the price of the object or its importance and a weight the physical weight (measured in kg or pounds)  or the size pf the object . The objective is to determine the combination of objects to place in the knapsack in order to maximizes the totale value while respecting the weight constraint of the knapsack
